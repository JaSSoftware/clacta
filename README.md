Close Active Tab in Chrome

[using ChatGPT]
Answer these questions as an experienced Chromebook Extension developer. What is needed to create a Chromebook extension to close the active tab? While surfing the internet using Google chrome, it is not uncommon to have several tabs open at the same time. However, when it comes time to close a certain tab - it is difficult to click on the correct tab, especially when the tab keeps getting smaller and smaller the more tabs are open.

To solve this problem explicitly: create a chrome extension that can close the active tab when required as easily as possible with the least amount of steps. The advantage of this type of chrome extension, is that the 'button' will always be in the same place on the screen and browser window.
